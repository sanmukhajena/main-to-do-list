## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running on your machine

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
   cd your-repository-name
Installation and Setup
To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps.

Prerequisites
Node.js: You need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from the official Node.js website.

MongoDB: Ensure you have a MongoDB instance running, either locally or via a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

Setup Steps
Clone the Repository: Start by cloning the project from GitHub.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Backend Setup:

Navigate to the backend directory:

Bash

cd backend
Install the required Node.js packages:

Bash

npm install
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your MongoDB connection string.

MONGO_URI='your_mongodb_connection_string'
Start the backend server:

Bash

node server.js
Frontend Setup:

Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

Bash

cd ../frontend
Install the required React packages:

Bash

npm install
Start the frontend development server:

Bash

npm start
The application should now be running. The frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000 and the backend at http://localhost:5000.
